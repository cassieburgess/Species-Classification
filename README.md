### BeeForagingMaps2016

This project involves using quadrotors equipped with an RGB camera to build maps of landscapes in the Bernard Field Station. These maps will be analyzed using image processing algorithms, and ground photos of flowers will be fed into machine learning software to create a continuous map of flower density. 

This repository represents progress made on the software throughout Spring and Summer of 2016. For old results and code see Bee-Foraging-Maps repository. A new repo was created in order to preserve final summer results as easily accesible while also continuing progress. Comparison between 2016 and 2015 results will be frequent, so storing separate versions of the code, rather than simply using GitHub's version control system, will be beneficial.'
